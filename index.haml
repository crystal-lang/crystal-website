  %h1 Language Goals
  %ul.goals
    %li Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
    %li Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.
    %li Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
    %li Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.
    %li Compile to efficient native code.
