  While focused towards those with programming experience, previous knowledge of Crystal itself is not required, as
  the book is outlined with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts and practical examples. By the end of
  this
  book, youâ€™ll be equipped with the skills you need to use Crystal programming for building and understanding any
  application you come across.
