Building a programming language from scratch is not an easy feat.
It takes long hours, quite a few headaches and some very talented developers.
It’s also not cheap, and we don’t have the financial backing that a multinational corporation would:
this project was funded with our own work and the contribution of a bunch of generous souls all over the globe.

While we have a dedicated team working on the development of Crystal,
we need all the help we can get to realize its potential,
and below is a list of all the humans and organizations that have made it possible for us to get this far.

  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <dl>
  <dt>What is this list?</dt>
  <dd markdown="1">
  These are the companies and individuals contributing to help sustain
  Crystal's development. See the [Open Collective campaign](https://opencollective.com/crystal-lang)
  for more details.
  </dd>

  <dt>I am a sponsor contributing $5/month, but my URL is not listed</dt>
  <dd markdown="1">
  We grab the website and avatar from your [Open Collective profile](https://opencollective.com)
  or your [Bountysource profile](https://www.bountysource.com/settings).
  If that fails, we try to use your GitHub or Twitter accounts listed in
  that same profile.
  </dd>

  <dt>When is this page updated?</dt>
  <dd markdown="1">
  We update the current sponsors in this page at the beginning of each
  month.
  </dd>

  <dt>How is the list ordered?</dt>
  <dd markdown="1">
  It is ordered by level of contribution and total amount contributed so
  far. Columns are sortable.
  </dd>

  <dt>How long are contributors listed?</dt>
  <dd markdown="1">
  Open Collective contributors are listed forever, but after three months of
  the last payment they are considered as contributing $0 (that is, no link
  is shown). Bounty Source contributors are erased as long as the site
  consider them inactive, for technical reasons.
  </dd>

  <dt>There seems to be an error, how can I fix it?</dt>
  <dd markdown="1">
  If there is any mismatch information you would like to correct, please [contact us](mailto:crystal@manas.tech).
