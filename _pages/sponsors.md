Building a programming language from scratch is not an easy feat.
It takes long hours, quite a few headaches and some very talented developers.
It’s also not cheap, and we don’t have the financial backing that a multinational corporation would:
this project was funded with our own work and the contribution of a bunch of generous souls all over the globe.

While we have a dedicated team working on the development of Crystal,
we need all the help we can get to realize its potential,
and below is a list of all the humans and organizations that have made it possible for us to get this far.
