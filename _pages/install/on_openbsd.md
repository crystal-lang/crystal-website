OpenBSD includes the Crystal compiler in the ports tree, starting from version OpenBSD 6.4.

Currently, it is only available for the `amd64` platform.

## Install Package

Crystal is available as a compiled package. However, it might not be the most recent version available. The package also includes `shards`.

<div class="code_section">
{% highlight bash %}
doas pkg_add crystal
{% endhighlight bash %}
</div>

## Install Port

For building Crystal yourself, the required installation is available in the ports tree.

If the ports collection is not already installed, instructions to installing it can be found in the [OpenBSD Ports guide](https://www.openbsd.org/faq/ports/ports.html).

<div class="code_section">
{% highlight bash %}
cd /usr/ports/lang/crystal
doas make clean install
{% endhighlight bash %}
</div>

To avoid building dependencies from source (which can take a long time), you can first install them from binary packages:

<div class="code_section">
{% highlight bash %}
doas pkg_add llvm libiconv boehm-gc libevent2 pcre libyaml
{% endhighlight bash %}
</div>
