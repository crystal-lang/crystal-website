The easiest way to install Crystal on macOS is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew update
brew install crystal
```

## Upgrade

When a new Crystal version is released you can upgrade your system using:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade crystal
```

## Tarball

Alternatively, there are `.tar.gz` and `.pkg` files in each [release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases)
for x86-64 and aarch64. See [Install from a tar.gz](/install/from_targz) for instructions.
