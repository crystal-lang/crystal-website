    <strong>Crystal Programming</strong> is a project-based book by George Dietrich and Guilherme Bernal that covers all the
    fundamental concepts needed to start programming in Crystal, such as OOP and concurrent programming.

    While focused towards those with programming experience, previous knowledge of Crystal itself is not required, as
    the book is outlined with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts and practical examples. By the end of
    this book, youâ€™ll be equipped with the skills you need to use Crystal programming for building and understanding any
    application you come across.
