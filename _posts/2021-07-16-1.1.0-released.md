We are releasing the first post-1.0 release, making efforts to keep our promise of making regular releases each 3 months, a bit delayed because of the [conference](/conference), and with special focus on keeping the language stability. Below we list the most important or interesting changes, without mentioning the several bugfixes. For details visit the [release's notes](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.1.0).

## Stats

In this release we included [166 PRs since the 1.0.0 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.1.0) by 28 contributors. We thank all the effort put into improving the language and its stdlib! ❤️

## Language changes

Splats can now be embedded in enumerable literals and in type definitions ([#10429](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10429)). A few examples:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
t1 = {1, 'a'}
t2 = {true, *t1} # => {true, 1, 'a'}
typeof(t2)       # => Tuple(Bool, Int32, Char)

def f1(x : {Bool, *{Int32, Char}}); end       # Works in type annotations too
def f2(x : Tuple(Bool, *{Int32, Char})); end

ae = 'a'..'e'
ccae = ['<', *ae, '>'] # => ['<', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', '>']

a = 1..10
b = 5..15

Set{*a, *b} # => Set{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
{% endhighlight crystal %}</div>

The type of a while expression is now the union of all break expressions within the body, plus `Nil` if the condition isn't exactly the `true` literal; the while expression returns `nil` if the condition fails. The type of a break expression is computed similarly to a break inside a block or a return (`Nil` if empty, `Tuple` if multiple values) ([#10566](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10566)).

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
# First the first non-blank line in STDIN
first_non_blank_line =
  while line = gets
    break line unless line.blank?
  end

puts first_non_blank_line
{% endhighlight crystal %}</div>

## Macros

It is now possible to access the top level module with the special instance variable `@top_level` ([#10682](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10682)):

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
FOO = 1
class Foo
    def bar
       {% raw %}{{@top_level.has_constant?("FOO")}{% endraw %}}  # true
    end
end
{% endhighlight crystal %}</div>

`NumberLiteral` now includes a `to_number` method to obtain the pure number, without any _stringification_ [#10802](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10802):

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
{% raw %}{{ p 10_u8.id }}{% endraw %}  # => 10_u8
{% raw %}{{ p 10_u8.to_number }}{% endraw %}  # => 10
{% endhighlight crystal %}</div>

We included a small breaking change, as there was a mismatch between the documentation and the code regarding `Path#global?`. The former `Path#global` is now deprecated in favor of `Path#global?`, whose name better represents it ([#10812](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10812)).

There is a new macro method `ASTNode#nil?` for querying if an object is the `NilLiteral` or `Nop` ([#10850](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10850), [#10616](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10616)).

## Stdlib

There were several changes that are not supposed to have a direct impact on the users. The most important one to note is that to help get better error messages and documentation, several methods were annotated with expected types. Adding typing annotations might break existing code in specific scenarios so, if this happens to you, please let us now. Also, we are growing the native Windows support, requiring several refactors.

### Numeric

It is now possible to create numbers from different representations using `new`, as in `Float32.new("1.1", whitespace:false)` (([#10422](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10422)).

We added `#positive?` and `#negative?` methods for `Number` and `Time::Span` ([#10601](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10601)).

`BigFloat` and `BigDecimal` got rounding modes ([#10618](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10618), [#10798](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10798)).

### Collections

Likewise to `Set`, the `Hash` class includes now sub/superset checking methods ([#7500](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/7500)):
* `Hash#subset_of?(other : Hash)`
* `Hash#proper_subset_of?(other : Hash)`
* `Hash#superset_of?(other : Hash)`
* `Hash#proper_superset_of?(other : Hash)`

Also, we  generalized `Number#step` with a new [`Steppable`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.1.0/Steppable.html) module, that is included in `Char`, `Number`, `Time` and `Time::Span` ([#10279](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10279)).

Finally, it is now possible to `#truncate` and `Array`, to efficiently remove elements from both ends ([#10712](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10712)).

### Crypto

New methods for getting peer certificates and signatures in `OpenSSL` ([#8005](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/8005)).

### Files

Now it is possible to use a `Path` for the methods in `FileUtils` ([#10747](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10747)).

### Networking

`OAuth2::Client` supports the customization of its `HTTP::Client` node ([10452](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10452)).

### Runtime

The segfault handler is now implemented in Crystal, in practice meaning that the compilation process of Crystal is simpler: it does not require the former external `libcrystal`. For package maintainers, this means building `libcrystal.a` (which was part of the `make deps` recipe) is obsolete now. The C code for this library has been removed and packaging instructions need to be updated. `make deps` is no longer necessary for building arbitrary Crystal programs; now it only builds `llvm_ext.a`, only required for linking against LLVM (for example when building the compiler itself).

### Serialization

The Yaml parser now supports `UUID` ([#10715](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10715)).


We have been able to do all of this thanks to the continued support of [84codes](https://www.84codes.com/), [Nikola Motor Company](https://nikolamotor.com/) and every other [sponsor](/sponsors). To maintain and increase the development pace, donations and sponsorships are essential. [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/crystal-lang) is available for that.
