[Crystal 0.32.1](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.32.1) has been released!

This release comes after a week of stabilizing the 0.32.0 with feedback mainly from the community. There were fixes and improvements that should unlock migrating to 0.32 in some contexts.

There are [6 commits since 0.32.0](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/compare/0.32.0...0.32.1) by 6 contributors.

Let's review some highlights in this release. And don't miss the rest of the [release changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.32.1).

The main updates for 0.32 can be found in the [release post of 0.32.0](/2019/12/11/crystal-0.32.0-released.html).

## Compiler

With recent changes regarding how string interpolation is handled there were some issues with long heredocs strings. Due to some internal safety guards restrictions in the compiler a generic type can't have more than 300 type arguments (probably reminiscent of that sparta movie). This 300 limit means that there can't be more than 300 pieces in a string interpolation. Each piece is a continuous string literal or an interpolation. In this release a line break in a heredoc string will not generate a different piece. Read more at [#8581](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/8581).

## Standard library

The `HTTP::WebSocket`'s `on_close` callback is now called upon any error kind and not only for `IO::EOFError`. Read more at [#8552](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/8552).

## Next steps

Please update your Crystal and report any issues. We will keep moving forward and start the development focusing on 0.33.

**It will also be helpful if your shards are run against Crystal nightly releases.** Either Docker or Snap are the current channels to get them easily. This will help reduce the friction of a release while checking if the ecosystem is in good shape.

We have been able to do all of this thanks to the continued support of [84codes](https://www.84codes.com/), and every other [sponsor](/sponsors). It is extremely important for us to sustain the support through donations, so that we can maintain this development pace. [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/crystal-lang) and [Bountysource](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/crystal-lang) are two available channels for that. Reach out to [crystal@manas.tech](mailto:crystal@manas.tech) if you'd like to become a direct sponsor or find other ways to support Crystal. We thank you in advance!
