I am Mekhla Mukherjee from Mumbai, Maharashtra in India, the land of food, culture and immense diversity.
I am bringing to Manas and Crystal my 12 years of expertise in customer service, product UI testing, user experience research and community development having worked with leading product brands like HP, Microsoft, Google and major service players Accenture and Wipro. My core passion lies in working with tech communities. I strongly believe an engaged and informed community has immense capabilities in contributing to the advancements in technology in the modern world.

While I never feel community development as work, traveling is my biggest hobby. I have toured 24 out of 29 states in India and few cities in Europe and the Middle East. When I am not traveling, I love cooking for my family. I am also a trained Indian classical singer and do enjoy playing the keyboard and jamming with my brother who plays the guitar himself.

In order to bring a positive impact to the world, society contribution is really important. I strongly believe every child has the right to education and working towards this direction, I contribute towards child education at UNICEF.

I have already heard some amazing things about Crystal, and I am excited to be part of this wonderful team and manage the Crystal community. I cannot wait to discover and learn from this new journey.
