It's an established fact that we in the Crystal language community are kind of obsessed with high-performance software.
While Crystal does a pretty good job of helping you write extremely fast applications which run on minimal resources,
there's limits to the scalability that any language can let you reach when it comes to distributed systems.
At some point (probably quite early indeed), you need to turn to your system's architecture design to ensure you can
sustain high and unpredictable loads.

One of the foundational architectural Lego blocks to address this kind of challenge is the good ol' queue. Using queues you can
make your applications resilient to sudden excesses in demand, impose order, maximize parallelism given your resource availability,
develop self-healing mechanisms, and a long list of other superpowers.

Needless to say, building a fast, reliable, secure and feature rich queue system is Hard(TM). Luckily, us crystallers are in fantastic
hands in that regard: [LavinMQ](https://lavinmq.com/) is a world class message queuing system that not only supports writing your queue publishers and consumers
in Crystal, but it is *built in Crystal* itself.

That's why we couldn't be more thrilled to share that, together with the LavinMQ team, [we will be co-running a Crystal+LavinMQ challenge](https://lavinmq.com/blog/lavinmq-crystal-hackathon)
in the context of the [Major League Hacking OpenSource Global Hack Week 2024](https://events.mlh.io/events/11512). This will be a super fun opportunity to learn how to
build robust message queueing architectures without leaving the comforts of Crystal <3.
