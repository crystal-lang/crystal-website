[Crystal 0.27.2](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.27.2) has been released!

This release includes some fixes that appeared in 0.27.1. So don’t miss the [0.27.1 release post](/2019/01/30/crystal-0.27.1-released.html), that is the real deal here.

Back to our regular stats, there were [5 commits since 0.27.1](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/compare/0.27.1...0.27.2) by 3 contributors.

You can view the changes in GitHub’s [release changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.27.2).

Yesterday was a great day, where each of the issues detected in the previous version got fixed at the same time by different members of the community. Go team! I mean..., Crystal team!
