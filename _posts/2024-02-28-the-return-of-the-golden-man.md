If you been paying attention to what's happening with [multi-threading support in Crystal](/2024/02/09/84codes-manas-mt/), you'll note that a name stands out: Julien Portalier. Also known as [@ysbaddaden](https://github.com/ysbaddaden), he had been part of the Crystal Core Team from 2015 until 2020. Now that he's taken on such a critical task, it only makes sense to bring him back to the Core Team.

As a side note, this comeback is [the second one in the last year](/2023/11/08/changes-in-the-teams/).

Welcome back, Julien! For many more years crystallizing!
