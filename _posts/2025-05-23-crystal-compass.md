[Manas.Tech](https://manas.tech/), the company behind Crystal, launches a new service:

[**Crystal Compass**](https://manas.tech/projects/crystal/crystal-compass/)
is a paid subscription that offers technical support and code reviews from the
creators of the Crystal language.

This is a service for people who use, or prepare to use, Crystal in production.
Our support service pairs production teams with Crystal experts,
providing PR reviews, architectural input, language guidance, and critical conversations.

Its goal is to strengthen Crystal's user community. We want to help both
current users and new adopters with simple and practical support.
This aims to make Crystal more attractive as a platform to build successful
products, while ensuring ongoing language development and maintenance.
