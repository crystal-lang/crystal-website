[Manas.Tech](https://manas.tech/), the company behind Crystal, launches a new service:

[**Crystal Compass**](https://manas.tech/projects/crystal/crystal-compass/)
is a paid subscription that offers technical support and code reviews from the
creators of the Crystal language.

This is a service for companies who use, or prepare to use, Crystal in production.
Our support service pairs production teams with Crystal experts,
providing PR reviews, architectural input, language guidance, and critical conversations.

Its goal is to strengthen Crystal's user community. We want to help those who use
Crystal in production and new adopters by offering a simple and uncomplicated support service.
This helps the project by securing funding for the people who work on the language,
and makes it more attractive as a platform to build a successful product.
