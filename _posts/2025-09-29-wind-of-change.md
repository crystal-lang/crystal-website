My time at Manas is coming to an end, though I will remain a Core Team member and continue to help develop the project from that seat. Johannes ([@straight-shoota](https://github.com/straight-shoota)) will be taking on the leading role of the project. Please join me in congratulating him on his new position!

While this might sound like a big change, in reality it isn’t: over the past year I’ve already been a bit distant from the project due to Manas’ own dynamics. Yet, Johannes and Julien have kept this tight ship on course, with just a bit of extra help. In essence, Johannes has already been a de facto leader.

As for myself, I will be leading the Theory of Computation group at [ORT University](https://www.ort.edu.uy/), returning to my other passions: teaching and research. Who knows, maybe I will finally get to do some cool research in Crystal!

This change marks the end of an amazing journey that began four years ago, leading an equally amazing group of people; building this amazing language we all love. I’m deeply grateful to Manas, the Core Team, and the Crystal community at large. The learnings that I gather will accompany me for the rest of my life. You’re wonderful!
