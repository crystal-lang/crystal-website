[Crystal 0.22.0](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.22.0) has been released!

As any release it includes numerous bugfixes, cool features and performance improvements.

# Exciting Changes

* Backtrace function names are read from DWARF sections.
* Sigfault and exceptions are printed to STDERR.
* `pp` and `p` return the printed value.
* `XML::Node` supports setting and deleting attributes.
* The `skip` macro method allows to skip a file: `{{ "{%" }} skip unless flag(:unix) %}`. No need to wrap entire files in `{{ "{%" }} if %}...{{ "{%" }} else %}` anymore!

Thanks to everyone who supported this release through contributions, reviews and suggestions.
