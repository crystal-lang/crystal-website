[Crystal 0.22.0](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.22.0) has been released!

As any release it includes numerous bugfixes, cool features and performance improvements.

# Exciting Changes

* Backtrace function names are now read from DWARF sections.
* Sigfault and exceptions are printed to STDERR.
* `pp` and `p` return the printed value.
* `XML::Node` supports setting and deleting attributes.
* The `skip` macro method allows to skip a file: `{{ "{%" }} skip unless flag(:unix) %}`. No need to wrap entire files in `{{ "{%" }} if %}...{{ "{%" }} else %}` anymore!

* **(breaking-change)** `IO#peek` now returns an empty slice on EOF
* **(breaking-change)** Rename `WeakRef#target` to `WeakRef#value`
* **(breaking-change)** Rename `HTTP::Params.from_hash` to `HTTP::Params.encode`
