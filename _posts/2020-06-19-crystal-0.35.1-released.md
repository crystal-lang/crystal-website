[Crystal 0.35.1](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.35.1) has been released!

This release is not as exciting as 0.35.0 if you missed that announcement [read it first](/2020/06/09/crystal-0.35.0-released.html).

This patch release is needed to iterate on some recent additions and fix a couple of regressions.

There are [13 commits since 0.35.0](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/compare/0.35.0...0.35.1) by 5 contributors.

Let’s get right into some of the highlights in this release. Don't miss out on the rest of the [release changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.35.1).

## Standard library

We reverted the changes in `IO#write` introduced in 0.35.0. They will return `Nil` as before. The intended change was more disruptive than we wanted. Apologies for the back and forth.

For the shards that were updated for 0.35.0 regarding this, it should be enough to compare against 0.35.0 exactly. For the shards that didn’t upgrade to 0.35.0, there is no action needed probably. Read more at [#9469](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/9469).

The OpenSSL client context is now configured by default with less strict ciphers compatibility for convenience. Ther server context enforces a more secure set. Read more at [#9459](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/9459).

## Next steps

Please update your Crystal and report any issues. We will keep moving forward and start the development focusing on 1.0.0. We expect to release some 1.0.0-preX to iterate on some final fixes.

All the deprecated definitions will be removed for 1.0. We want a clean 1.0.

We have been able to do all of this thanks to the continued support of [84codes](https://www.84codes.com/), [Nikola Motor Company](https://nikolamotor.com/) and every other [sponsor](/sponsors). It is extremely important for us to sustain the support through donations, so that we can maintain this development pace.
