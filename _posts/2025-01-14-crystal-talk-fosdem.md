I'm giving a talk about Crystal at FOSDEM 2025 in Brussels:
[_Crystal: A language for humans and computers_](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6306-crystal-a-language-for-humans-and-computers/).
It's in the [Declarative and Minimalistic Computing track](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/declarative/),
on Sunday, 2 February 2025 at 16:30 in room H.1308 (Rolin).

The talk is going to be an introduction into some concepts of Crystals.
It might be a tiny bit boring if you are already familiar with the language,
but I'm sure it'll still be worthwile.

If a couple of people are interested in a Crystal meetup, maybe
we can arrange to gather somewhere during FOSDEM. Let me know in the comments.
I'll bring some Crystal merch.

Hope to see you in Brussels!
