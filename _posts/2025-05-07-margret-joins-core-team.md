With great pleasure we announce that Margret Riegert ([nobodywasishere](https://github.com/nobodywasishere)) has joined the [Crystal Core Team](/team).

As an active contributor in the Crystal community for many years, she's shown great efforts, especially around improving tooling and developer experience.

One of her projects is [crystaldoc.info](https://www.crystaldoc.info/), a public service that generates and hosts API docs of Crystal shards.
In the process of implementing this she brought many improvements to the doc generator, including the new `:showdoc:` directive ([RFC 0011](https://github.com/crystal-lang/rfcs/pull/11)).

She participates in the [tree-sitter grammar](https://github.com/crystal-lang-tools/tree-sitter-crystal) and [zed plugin](https://github.com/crystal-lang-tools/zed-crystal) among other related projects
In [Ameba](https://github.com/crystal-ameba/ameba) she's implemented a number of rules and is trying to bring [semantic analysis into the linter](https://github.com/crystal-ameba/ameba/issues/513).
She also started [larimar](https://github.com/nobodywasishere/larimar), a new LSP for Crystal ([forum thread](https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/why-isnt-there-an-lsp-for-crystal/7687)).
