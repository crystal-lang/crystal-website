[Crystal 0.20.4](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.20.4) has been released!

As any release it includes numerous bugfixes, cool features and performance improvements - in [87 commits since 0.20.3](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/compare/0.20.3...0.20.4).

# Exciting Changes

* `JSON::Emitter` was renamed to `JSON::Builder` and can used for any JSON serialization using `JSON.build`.
* `to_json` methods now receives a `JSON::Builder` instead of an `IO`.
* `XML::Builder` allows to serialize XML format using `XML.build`.
* `MemoryIO` was removed in favour of `IO::Memory`.
* `with ... yield` now works well with `method_missing`.
* Class variables can now be used in generic types (all generic instances share the same variable, and subclasses get their own copy, as usual).
* Added support for LLVM 4.

Thanks to everyone who supported this release through contributions, reviews and suggestions.
