I'm giving a talk about Crystal at FOSDEM 2026 in Brussels:
[_Crystal: A language for humans and computers_](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/N3AFSF-crystal/).
It's in the [Declarative and Minimalistic Computing track](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/declarative-and-minimalistic-computing/),
on Sunday, 1 February 2026 at 09:00 in room UB4.136.

The talk is going to be an introduction into some concepts of Crystals.
If you are already familiar with the language, I hope it will still be worthwhile.

If a couple of people are interested in a Crystal meetup, maybe
we can arrange to gather somewhere during FOSDEM. Let me know in the comments.
I'll bring some Crystal merch.

Hope to see you in Brussels!

In case you can't make it, the talk is being recorded.

**UPDATE:** The talk recording is now available. Thanks to the video team at FOSDEM!
