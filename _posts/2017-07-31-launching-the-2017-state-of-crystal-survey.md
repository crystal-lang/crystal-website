Crystal is growing! As an awesome community, weâ€™d really like to hear your opinions and decide how we should plan for the future. We are pleased to announce the launch of the official [2017 State of Crystal Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/Afl1rqvaO3LcaxHr1)! Whether or not you use Crystal today, we really want to know your opinions. Your feedback will help Crystal understand its strengths and weaknesses, and to determine development priorities for the future.

Completing this survey should take about 5 to 10 minutes. Submissions will be accepted until around September 12th, 2017.

Please help us spread the word by sharing the above link on your social network feeds, at meetups, around your office and in other communities.
Finally, we wanted to thank everyone who helped develop, polish, and test Crystal!

Happy Crystalling!
