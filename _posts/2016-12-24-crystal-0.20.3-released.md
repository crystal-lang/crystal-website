[Crystal 0.20.3](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.20.3) has been released!

As any release it includes numerous bugfixes, cool features and performance improvements - in [130 commits since 0.20.1](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/compare/0.20.1...0.20.3).

# Exciting Changes

* `IO#gets`, `IO#each_line`, `String#lines`, `String#each_line`, etc. now chomp lines by default. You can pass `chomp: false` to prevent automatic chomping.
* `HTTP::Handler` is no longer a class but a module.
* Free variables now must be specified with `forall`, a single uppercase letter will not work anymore.
* `libs` directory is removed from `CRYSTAL_PATH`, libraries should be put in `lib`.
* `class_getter`, `class_setter` and `class_property` macros were added.
* When compiling with `--debug` the `:debug` flag is present.

Thanks to everyone who supported this release through contributions, reviews and suggestions.
