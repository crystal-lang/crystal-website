[Crystal 0.23.1](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.23.1) has been released!

This release includes only a few bugfixes - in [8 commits since 0.23.1](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/compare/0.23.1...0.24.1).

The biggest changes are not in the compiler's codebase, but in the release process. Specifically, compatibility with older platforms lost in the 0.23.0 release has been recovered (Debian 7/Ubuntu 14.04, Centos 6), while keeping the builds with LLVM 3.8.

Thanks to everyone who supported this release through contributions, reviews and suggestions.
