The [conference](/events/2023-crystal-berlin) was a pivoting time for the Crystal Team —the team that works for Crystal at [Manas](https://manas.tech)— and the Core Team —the team that governs Crystal. For the Crystal Team, it meant the last event and posting by —now former— Crystal Community Manager, [Mekhla Mukherjee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mekhla-mukherjee/). Mekhla has done a terrific job building the Ambassadors Program, helping organize the conference, and taking care of the general communications of the project. Unfortunately, the funding to keep a full-time position on communication for the program run out, so we are now back to the previous model of communication. Beta Ziliani will take care of the Ambassadors Program, and the communications will be handled by the team or an external party in a by-the-hour basis.

We want to take the time to thank Mekhla once again for her work. She will be missed by the team.

To end this communication on a positive note, in the conference we had the visit of Stephanie, also known in the community as RX14, a former Core Team member. If you watched the panel discussion, you might remember her participation in it. We invited her back, and we are thrilled to announce her acceptance. So, welcome back Stephie!
