Following GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization"><i>Triage role</i></a>, we decided to create the _Community moderator_ role.
This new role allows active participants of the community to be granted the ability to assign labels, open/close issues/PRs, apply milestones, mark duplicates, assign issues/PRs and request reviews. This role provides a middle-ground between regular contributors and core team members.

Community moderators are listed in the relevant section at the <a href="/team#moderators">Team page</a>. If you are an active contributor of the project and feel you can level up your involvement with it, check the <a href="/team#join_us">Join the Team</a> section.
