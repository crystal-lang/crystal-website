We are releasing the first patch release of the [1.1](https://crystal-lang.org/2021/07/16/1.1.0-released.html) series. 

## Stats

In this patch release we included [9 PRs since the 1.1.0 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.1.1) by 2 contributors. This time we'd like to thank the developers that suffered and issued the regressions ❤️ Sorry about that!

There are just two relevant changes to point out:

## Language changes

We had to revert the name of the top-level module. Prior to 1.1.0 it was `main`, but since we created a new accessor called [`@top_level`](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/syntax_and_semantics/macros/index.html#the-top-level-module), we thought we should call it `top_level` too. Unfortunately that broke a shard, so we revert it to its former name ([#10993](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10993)).

## Stdlib

As we mentioned in the [1.1.0 release](https://crystal-lang.org/2021/07/16/1.1.0-released.html), we started adding type information to methods of the stdlib, for documentation and better error reporting. Unfortunately, a few annotations were too restrictive and broke existing shards: `Array#index` and `Array#rindex` return types were erased ([10972](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10972)).
