With great pleasure we announce the reincorporation of [Martin Verzilli](https://github.com/mverzilli) to the [Core Team of Crystal](/team).  Martin is the current CTO of [Manas.Tech](https://manas.tech), with a large record of experience in different languages and technologies.

He was previously part of the initial group of people that started the Core Team back in [the early stages of Crystal](./2016-12-29-crystal-new-year-resolutions-for-2017-1-0.md).
And now he's returning to an active and growing role in the project.

Welcome back, Martin!
