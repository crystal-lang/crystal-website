A couple months ago I gave a talk at [Helvetic Ruby 2024](https://helvetic-ruby.ch/2024) about Crystal.
It's tailored to the perspective of Rubyists, but prior Ruby experience is not required to follow along.

The recording is [available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdOh82qLzZQ):

The conference did not allow questions from the audience. But there were great opportunities for socializing and discussion with the speakers during long breaks between talks.
During the event I got to talk to many people about Crystal.
The exposure had a very wide range: Some had never heard of Crystal, others had wanted to learn more and try it out, and quite a few were already experienced using it in production.
