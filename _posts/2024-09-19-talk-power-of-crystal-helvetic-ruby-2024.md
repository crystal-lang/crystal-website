I gave a talk at [Helvetic Ruby 2024](https://helvetic-ruby.ch/2024) about Crystal.
It's tailored to the perspective of Rubyists, but prior Ruby experience is not required to follow along.

The recording is [available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdOh82qLzZQ):

The conference did not allow questions from the audience. But there were great opportunities for socializing and discussion with the speakers during long breaks between talks.
During the event I got to talk to many people about Crystal.
The exposure to Crystal spans a very wide range: Some had never heard of Crystal, others had wanted to learn more and try it out, and quite a few enthusiasts with experience in production use.

I really enjoyed the experience. It was a great opportunity to expose Crystal to different audiences.
In many encounters we discussed the features and future of Crystal.
I'd like to encourage everyone to do that as well. It's great to meet peers and exchange ideas, be it in a physical location or a virtual space.

If you'd like to spread the word about Crystal in a talk, workshop or other event, feel free to reach out for support.
The Crystal Team is happy to help you shape it.
