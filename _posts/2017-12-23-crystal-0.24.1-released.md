[Crystal 0.24.1](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.24.1) has been released!

As any release it includes numerous bugfixes, cool features and performance improvements - in [387 commits since 0.23.1](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/compare/0.23.1...0.24.1).

0.24.0 was a preview release so this is the canonical realease following 0.23.1.

# Exciting Changes

* With `ThinLTO`, LLVM 4.0 and above allows faster release builds.
* `SecureRandom` is renamed to `Random::Secure` and `SecureRandom.uuid` is replaced by a new type: `UUID` created using `UUID.random`
* `BigDecimal` offers arbitrary precision, exact decimal numbers, supplementing `BigInt` and `BigFloat` which all are required by `require "big"`.
* `Set` instances can be used as condition for `case`, matching when the case variable is included in the set.
* `Time::Format` more robustly supports parsing sub-second precision.
* `Tempfile` supports custom extensions.
* The docs generator outputs documentation as JSON which can be easily parsed and used for external applications. The output directory of the docs generator can be configured using `--output` flag.
* Garbage collection can be disabled using compiler flag `-Dgc_none`.
* The default hash function uses an algorithm based on FunnyHash which is resiliant against DoS attacks.
* `HTML.escape` only escapes HTML special characters `&<>"'`. `HTML.escape` recognizes all HTML5 named entities.
* Multiple assignment can no longer be used to create an array (`a = 1, 2, 3`).
* `skip` macro method was renamed to `skip_file`.
* `rescue`, `ensure` and `else` blocks can be used directly in `do ...end` blocks.

<div class="code_section">{% highlight ruby %}
%w(foo bar).each do |x|
  raise x
rescue e
  p e
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}</div>

* `fun` names and lib function calls can start with uppercase.
* YAML 1.1 core schema is fully supported.
* `Time` and `Time::Span` have nanosecond precision.
* `Time.monotonic` and `Time.measure { ... }` allow reading and measuring time using a monotonic clock not influences by time zones, leap seconds and time corrections.
* `Crystal.main` was added to allow more easily redefining the `main` of a program.
* Named tuples can be merged using `NamedTuple#merge(other : NamedTuple)`.
* `YAML` and `JSON` mappings support `presence: true` option.
* `Dir` has two new class methods: `children` and `each_child { ... }` which include all entries except `.` and `..`.

Thanks to everyone who supported this release through contributions, reviews and suggestions.
