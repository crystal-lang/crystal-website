CrystalConf 2023 took place in Berlin on 23rd and 24th October 2023, in hybrid mode.

With a global community and contributions from people worldwide, Crystal has achieved a strong space in the programming world.
To celebrate Crystal’s journey, users, developers, and contributors of our beloved language gathered to share their experiences.

Attendees were able to join in person in Berlin or connect via live stream. Recordings of the talks are available.
