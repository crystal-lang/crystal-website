Hej! We're excited to announce a Crystal user meetup on 18 February 2025 in Stockholm.
It's a joint effort together with [LavinMQ], a message broker application
written in Crystal.

A big part of the Core Team is coming to Sweden. Our friends from LavinMQ and
[84codes] are hosting an evening meetup where you can learn more about Crystal,
and listen to user experiences. It'll be a nice open source community gathering.
We're expecting guests with and without a Crystal background.

The evening will feature two exciting talks:

- Project lead Beta Ziliani shares the journey of Crystal and gives an
  introduction to the language.
- Carl Hörberg, CEO at 84codes/LavinMQ talks about the experience of building
  LavinMQ with Crystal.

After the talks, there will be time to mingle, ask questions, and get to know
the community. Space is limited, so make sure to secure your spot now.

Attendance is free of charge, but we ask to register in advance. You can find
more information on the [registration page].

The meetup takes place on February 18th from 5.30–7.30 PM at Guldbaren
(the ground-level bar at [United Spaces, Torsgatan 26]).
United Spaces is easily accessible on foot from either T-centralen or
S:t Eriksplan subway stations.

Happy to see you there!
