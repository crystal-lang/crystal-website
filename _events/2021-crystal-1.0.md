We are unbelievably proud to announce that, after years of hard work, we finally have a [1.0 version of Crystal!](/2021/03/22/crystal-1.0-what-to-expect/)

For a long, long time, it was accepted that programming languages couldn’t be simultaneously programmer-friendly and efficient. In 2011, we set out to prove that assumption was wrong. Crystal is the result of that experiment, and the source of much joy, fun and growth for everyone involved.

With thousands of contributions from people worldwide, it was finally possible to reach the level of maturity required for a 1.0 milestone.

And that calls for celebration!

The Crystal Conference will be livestreamed, to make sure that the entire global community that has formed around Crystal can attend.
