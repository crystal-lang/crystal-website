        Get ready for CrystalConf 2023! This year it will take place in Berlin on 23rd and 24th October 2023, in hybrid mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crystal is now in its 1.9.2 version and with a global community and contributions from people worldwide, Crystal has achieved a strong space in the programming world.
        To celebrate Crystal’s journey, we are inviting users, developers, and contributors in general of our beloved language to share this experience with us and the rest of the community.
      </p>

      <p>
        The attendees will be able to takeaway learnings from a lot of amazing presentations from technology and industry experts.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we would be very thrilled to meet the speakers and the community in person, CrystalConf 2023 will be a hybrid event.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event will be livestreamed, in order to ensure maximum participation from the global community.
