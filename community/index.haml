    # Community

    There are about so many ways to get involved in Crystal. Here's a list of our main communication channels.

  :markdown
    ## Security

    Should you find any security-related issue, please do not share openly in the issue tracker. We have a dedicated [security@manas.tech](mailto:security@manas.tech) mailbox where we keep track of them.

    You can encrypt your message [via Keybase](https://keybase.io/crystal){:target="_blank"}, or standard PGP (our fingerprint is `5995 C83C D754 BE44 8164 1929 0961 7FD3 7CC0 6B54`).

    ## GitHub

    The [`crystal` official code repository](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/){:target="_blank"} is on GitHub, so any bugs you find in either the language, compiler or standard library should be reported here - and pull requests are always welcome.

%section
  :markdown
    ## Mailing list

    The [crystal-lang Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crystal-lang){:target="_blank"} is the first to-go place for any general discussion. Feel free to ask a question, share your project with others, ask for guidance and best practices, offer your help contributing to a project, or anything else Crystal-related.

%section
  :markdown
    ## Blog

    In the official [Crystal blog](https://crystal-lang.org/#blog) you can find the detailed announcements for new releases, some interesting use cases, the rationale behind some of the language's design decisions and things the team write around the code they usually write.

    We also accept posts from guest writers, so if you have something awesome you have built with Crystal, [contact us](mailto:crystal@manas.tech "Or pick any other channel listed here") and we'll be happy to have you featured on the blog.

    ## Gitter/IRC

    The [crystal-lang/crystal Gitter room](https://gitter.im/crystal-lang/crystal){:target="_blank"} is the official chat room for Crystal. You can drop a quick question here to try and get it answered quickly, ask for guidance, or engage on a short discussion on a feature or project you are interested in. Make sure to keep the discussion organised, and consider using the mailing list if the chat drags for too long.

    If you are more of an IRC kind of person, the [`#crystal-lang` channel at irc.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23crystal-lang){:target="_blank"}, which keeps its logs in [irclog.crystal-lang.org](https://irclog.crystal-lang.org){:target="_blank"}, is bridged to the Gitter room, so anything sent on one channel is forwarded to the other one.

%section
  :markdown
    ## Twitter

    The [@CrystalLanguage](https://twitter.com/CrystalLanguage){:target="_blank"} account will often tweet general announcements on releases and events, and retweet any interesting articles from the tweetosphere. Be sure to mention it if you are tweeting about Crystal!

%section
  :markdown
    ## Reddit

    The [Crystal Programming subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/crystal_programming/){:target="_blank"} contains announcements on new releases, interesting libraries, blog posts, and is in general a good place to share your work with the rest of the Crystal community.

%section
  :markdown
    ## Stack Overflow

    Of course, there is a [crystal-lang tag in StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crystal-lang?sort=newest){:target="_blank"}. Ask for help with your Crystal project there, or help other people solve theirs - learning & sharing all the way through.

    ## Awesome Crystal
