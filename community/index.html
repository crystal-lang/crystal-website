  <h1 id="community">Community</h1>
  
  <p>There are about so many ways to get involved in Crystal. Here's a list of our main communication channels.</p>
</section>
<section class='callout'>
  <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
  
  <p>Should you find any security-related issue, please do not share openly in the issue tracker. We have a dedicated <a href="mailto:security@manas.tech">security@manas.tech</a> mailbox where we keep track of them.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="github">Github</h2>
  
  <p>The <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/"><code>crystal</code> official code repository</a> is on Github, so any bugs you find in either the language, compiler or standard library should be reported here - and pull requests are always welcome.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="mailing-list">Mailing list</h2>
  
  <p>The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crystal-lang">crystal-lang Google Group</a> is the first to-go place for any general discussion. Feel free to ask a question, share your project with others, ask for guidance and best practices, offer your help contributing to a project, or anything else Crystal-related.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="blog">Blog</h2>
  
  <p>In the official <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/#blog">Crystal blog</a> you can find the detailed announcements for new releases, some interesting use cases, the rationale behind some of the language's design decisions and things the team write around the code they usually write.</p>
  
  <p>We also accept posts from guest writers, so if you have something awesome you have built with Crystal, <a href="mailto:crystal@manas.tech" title="Or pick any other channel listed here">contact us</a> and we'll be happy to have you featured on the blog.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="gitterirc">Gitter/IRC</h2>
  
  <p>The <a href="https://gitter.im/crystal-lang/crystal">crystal-lang/crystal Gitter room</a> is the official chat room for Crystal. You can drop a quick question here to try and get it answered quickly, ask for guidance, or engage on a short discussion on a feature or project you are interested in. Make sure to keep the discussion organised, and consider using the mailing list if the chat drags for too long.</p>
  
  <p>If you are more of an IRC kind of person, the <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23crystal-lang"><code>#crystal-lang</code> channel at irc.freenode.net</a>, which keeps its logs in <a href="https://irclog.crystal-lang.org">irclog.crystal-lang.org</a>, is bridged to the Gitter room, so anything sent on one channel is forwarded to the other one.</p>
