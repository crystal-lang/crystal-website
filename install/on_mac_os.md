subtitle: On macOS

To easily install Crystal on macOS you can use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew update
brew install crystal
```

You should be able to install the latest version from homebrew. Crystal's core-team help maintain that formula.

Alternative there are `.tar.gz` and `.pkg` files in each [release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases) targeted for darwin. See [Install from a tar.gz](/install/from_targz)

## Upgrade

When a new Crystal version is released you can upgrade your system using:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade crystal
```

## Troubleshooting

### On macOS 10.14 (Mojave)

If you get an error like:

```text
ld: library not found for -lssl (this usually means you need to install the development package for libssl)
```

you may need to install OpenSSL and link pkg-config to OpenSSL:

```bash
brew install openssl
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig
```

As with other keg-only formulas there are some caveats shown in `brew info <formula>` that shows how to link `pkg-config` with this library.

The Crystal compiler will by default use `pkg-config` to find the locations of libraries to link with.
