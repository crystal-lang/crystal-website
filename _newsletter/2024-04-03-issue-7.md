## People are saying

- [@Joshsharp](https://fosstodon.org/@Joshsharp@aus.social/111962659264632015): Crystal is a happy medium between Rust and Python, the two other languages I use the most, so I'm generally having a good time.
- [@MistressRemilia](https://fosstodon.org/@remilia@nanako-%E3%81%95%E3%82%81.mooo.com/111986120091387916): Tonight I finally got around to reading the [new proposed RFCs](https://github.com/crystal-lang/rfcs) for [#CrystalLang](https://fosstodon.org/tags/CrystalLang) and whew, I am excited af.
- [@Evan Hahn:](https://evanhahn.com/introducing-sqids-crystal/) Because Crystal is so similar to Ruby, it was a small effort to port [Sqids Ruby](https://sqids.org/ruby) to Crystal. For the most part, I was able to copy-paste the code and make some small changes:
- [@ex0ticOne](https://www.reddit.com/r/crystal_programming/comments/192vby1/new_to_crystal_so_happy_to_discover_and_i_already/): After discovering Crystal and Kemal, I rewrote the webservice with success and deployed the new version. Works like a charm and with an incredible low latency.
