* Fast as C
* Slick as Ruby
* Crystal uses [green threads](/), called fibers, to achieve concurrency. Fibers communicate with each other using channels, as in Go or Clojure, without   having to turn to shared memory or locks.
* Crystal libraries are packed as Shards, and distributed via Git without needing a centralised repository.

  Built in commands allow dependencies to be easily specified through a YAML file and fetched from their respective repositories.
