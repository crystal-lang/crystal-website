**Crystal’s** syntax is *heavily* inspired by [Ruby’s](https://ruby-lang.org/).

So it feels natural to read and ***easy*** to write, and has the added benefit of
a lower learning curve for experienced Ruby devs: `cat [crystal](https://) > /dev/brain`.

The **slick** syntax makes it easy to `read` for humans, but it's also [**fast** on machines](/).

On [the *Crystal Forum* you can meet `humans` interested in Crystal](https://forum.crystal-lang.org).

Press <kbd>Ctr+C</kbd> to end the process.
