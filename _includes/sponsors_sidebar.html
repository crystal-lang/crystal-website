      <h3>What is this list?</h3>
      These are the companies and individuals contributing a monthly amount to help sustain Crystal's development. See

      <h3>I am a sponsor contributing $5/month, but my URL is not listed</h3>
      We grab the website and avatar from your
      <a class="contributing-link" href="https://opencollective.com" target="_blank">Open Collective profile</a> or your
      <a class="contributing-link" href="https://www.bountysource.com/settings" target="_blank">Bountysource profile</a>. If that fails, we try to use your GitHub or Twitter accounts listed in
      that same profile.
    </p>

      We update the current sponsors in this page every other week.
