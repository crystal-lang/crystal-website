## Linuxbrew

If you have [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) installed you're ready to install Crystal:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight bash %}
brew update
brew install crystal-lang
{% endhighlight bash %}</div>

If you're planning to contribute to the language itself you might find useful to install LLVM as well. So replace the last line with:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight bash %}
brew install crystal-lang --with-llvm
{% endhighlight bash %}</div>
