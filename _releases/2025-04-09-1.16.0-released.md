We are announcing a new Crystal release 1.16.0 with several new features and bug fixes.

Pre-built packages are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.16.0)
and our official distribution channels.
See [crystal-lang.org/install](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) for
installation instructions.

## Stats

This release includes [162 changes since 1.15.1](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.16.0)
by 19 contributors.  We thank all the contributors for all the effort put into
improving the language! ❤️

## Changes

Below we list the most remarkable changes in the language, compiler and stdlib.
For more details, visit the [full changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.16.0).

### Breaking

The following changes break prior behavior of the compiler, but we expect them to not break much in existing code. If this is not the case, please let us know in the [issue tracker] or [forum].

#### Fixed implementation of `File.match?`

The implementation of [`File.match?`] was insufficient and has been replaced by a new algorithm.
This change should not affect any behaviour that was previously working as documented.

The correction of implementation bugs leads to the following changes in observed behaviour:

- Wildcard and globstar are able to match non-greedily. For example, `**/a` now matches `a`.
- Globstar matches full path segments only, otherwise it's just two wildcards (which is equivalent to a single one). For example, `a**` no longer matches `ab/c` (but it matches `ab`).
- Subpatterns in branches are parsed with respect to their respective syntactical context. For example, `{[}]}` now matches `}`.
  It parses as a branch with one subpattern that describes the character set `}`. Previously, this was a parse error.
- Escapes for special character are recognized. For example, `\\t` now matches `\t` while previously it matched `t`.
- The grammar for parsing character classes is more flexible. For example, `[a-]`, now matches `a` and `-`. Previously, it was a pattern error (incomplete character range).

Note: [`Dir.glob`] is implemented differently and is not affected by that invalid behaviour. There were no changes to it.

_Thanks, [@straight-shoota]_

#### Parameter name suffixes are deprecated

The suffixes `?` and `!` for parameter names of defs, macros and blocks are deprecated.  This aligns them with other variable names.  They produce a warning now ([#12197]).
_Thanks, [@potomak]_

[#12197]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/12197

#### Implicit return type of `Enumerable#sum` and `#product`

[`Enumerable#sum`] and [`#product`][`Enumerable#product`] no longer resolve an implicit return type when the element type is a union. This can't work reliably.
Instead, you need to specify the sum/product type explicitly by the `initial` parameter with a value of the intended return type ([#15314]).
In effect, this moves a runtime error condition to a compile time error.

```cr
# Crystal 1.16.0
[1, 10000000000_u64].sum # Error: `Enumerable#sum` and `#product` do not support Union types.
                         # Instead, use `Enumerable#sum(initial)` and `#product(initial)`,
                         # respectively, with an initial value of the intended type of the call.

# Crystal < 1.16.0
[1, 10000000000_u64].sum # OverflowError: Arithmetic overflow

# Passing an explicit initial value works, before and after:
[1, 10000000000_u64].sum(0_u64) # => 10000000001_u64
```

_Thanks, [@rvprasad]_

#### Resource string in `HTTP::Request`

[`HTTP::Request`] was fixed to correctly parse HTTP resource strings that look like an absolute URL.
This may break code that relied on the previous, buggy behaviour ([#15499]).

```cr
# Crystal 1.16.0
HTTP::Request.new("GET", "http://example.com/foo").path # => "http://example.com/foo"

# Crystal < 1.16.0
HTTP::Request.new("GET", "http://example.com/foo").path # => "/foo"
```

_Thanks, [@straight-shoota]_

[#15499]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15499

#### Environment changes for subcommands

The compiler won't set the environment variable `$CRYSTAL` when running a process for a subcommand.
This variable was only in introduced in [#14953] in 1.14.0.
We addded a more flexible alternative `$CRYSTAL_EXEC_PATH`, and the equivalent to `$CRYSTAL` is now `$CRYSTAL_EXEC_PATH/crystal`. The compiler also prepends its path to `$PATH` ([#15186]).

_Thanks, [@straight-shoota]_

### Execution Contexts

Execution contexts from [RFC 0002] are available as a preview feature.
It has already proven to be quite robust, but there might be some rough edges.

You can test execution contexts with the compiler flags `-Dpreview_mt -Dexecution_context`.
The default context is single threaded (unlike standalone `-Dpreview_mt`).
But you can then start additional contexts as you need (for example, a [`Fiber::ExecutionContext::MultiThreaded`] or [`Fiber::ExecutionContext::Isolated`]).

```cr
mt_context = Fiber::ExecutionContext::MultiThreaded.new("worker-threads", 4)

10.times do
  mt_context.spawn do
    do_something
  end
end

gtk = Fiber::ExecutionContext::Isolated.new("Gtk") do
  Gtk.main
end

mt_context.wait
gtk.wait
```

Execution contexts are supported on most targets, including, Linux, macOS, Windows and the different BSDs, on X86 and ARM architectures.
This addition marks the peak of the [ongoing project to improve multi-threading support] with the help of [84codes].

### Language

- [`Slice.literal`] can infer the element type ([#15529]) and works in the interpreter ([#15531]).

_Thanks, [@HertzDevil]_

- Macro [`sizeof`][`Crystal::Macros#sizeof`] and [`alignof`][`Crystal::Macros#alignof`] provide information on stable types ([#15497]).

_Thanks, [@HertzDevil]_

[#15531]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15531
[#15497]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15497

### Standard library

- Several bug fixes and performance improvements to `Path` handling, especially for Windows paths.

_Thanks, [@HertzDevil]_

- New methods [`Indexable#find`] and [`#find!`][`Indexable#find!`] ([#15552]).

_Thanks, [@punteek]_

- New methods [`EventLoop#wait_readable`], [`#wait_writable`] ([#15376]).

_Thanks, [@ysbaddaden]_

[#15552]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15552
[#15376]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15376

### Compiler

- The compiler CLI understand the long option `--output` everywhere, instead of just the short variant `-o` ([#15519]). It also accepts a directory name as value, in which case the file name is derived from the source filename ([#15471]).

_Thanks, [@HertzDevil], [@straight-shoota]_

- The compiler respects the environment variable `$MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, which gets
  rid of annoying linker warnings when target versions are mismatched ([#15603])

_Thanks, [@HertzDevil]_

[#15519]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15519
[#15471]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15471
[#15603]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15603

### Compiler tools

The doc generator can optionally include `private` and `protected` objects as well as objects in lib bindings (`lib`, `fun`, `union`, `cstruct`, `external`, and `type`), as proposed in [RFC 0011](https://github.com/crystal-lang/rfcs/blob/main/text/0011-extending-api-docs.md). The `:showdoc:` directive enables that.

```crystal
# :showdoc:
#
# Documentation for LibFoo
lib Foo
  # Documentation for function foo
  fun foo : Void
end

# :showdoc:
#
# Documentation for method bar
private def bar
end
```

_Thanks [@nobodywasishere]_

### Dependency Updates

- Support for LLVM 20 ([#15412])

_Thanks, [@HertzDevil]_

[#15412]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/15412

### Deprecations

- [`LLVM::ABI`] (and [`LLVM::TargetMachine#abi`]) is deprecated without replacement ([#15227]).
