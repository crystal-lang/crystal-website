## Changes

Below we list the most remarkable changes in the language, compiler and stdlib.
For more details, visit the [full changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.16.1).

This change brings a couple of bugfixes for regressions introduced in 1.16.0.

* Reading from stdin in `crystal eval` works again ([#15655])
* Linking libxml2 on Windows now implicitly links `bcrypt`, as necessary since version 2.13 ([#15651])

Other bug fixes:

* Transfering file descriptors between execution contexts now works correctly and raises correctly in case of error ([#15650], [#15663])
* Version discovery for `libgc` via pkg-config uses the system-specific package name ([#15636])

We also enhanced the documentation for execution contexts ([#15644], [#15659], [#15664], [#15665]).
