We are releasing the first patch release of the [1.7](/2023/01/09/1.7.0-released/) series.

Pre-built packages are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.7.1) and our official distribution channels.
See [crystal-lang.org/install](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) for installation instructions.

This patch only includes a bugfix for a regression introduced in 1.7.0 affecting the playground. With this patch the playground should be working again. If you find any further issue, please [report it](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/).
