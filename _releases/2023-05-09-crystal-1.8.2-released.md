We are releasing the second patch release of the [1.8](/2023/04/14/1.8.0-released/) series.

Pre-built packages are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.8.2) and our official distribution channels.
See [crystal-lang.org/install](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) for installation instructions.

This release includes [7 changes since 1.8.1](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.8.2) by 3 contributors. We thank all the contributors for all the effort put into improving the language! ❤️

It fixes a couple minor bugs in the standard library and one in the compiler codegen.
Most relevant is a regression in 1.8.1 regarding `JSON::Serializable` on certain recursively defined types ([#13430](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/13430)).
