## Stats

In this release we included [12 changes since the 1.6.0 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.6.1) by 7 contributors. We thank all the effort put into improving the language! ❤️

## Compiler

There were a couple of regressions in the compiler which are now fixed.

1.6.1 refactored the ordering of `def` overloads to be more robust ([#10711](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/10711)). A regression caused incorrect ordering for methods with splat arguments, which is fixed in [#12584](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/12584).

Additional regressions are fixed in the formatter with escape sequences in macro literals ([#12582](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/12582)) and the playground considering `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` as different origins ([#12599](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/12599)).

The interpreter received a couple of minor improvements. Most notable feature is the welcome message which is printed to `STDERR` when starting the interpreter ([#12511](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/12511)). It can be disabled by setting the environment variable `CRYSTAL_INTERPRETER_SKIP_BANNER=1`.
