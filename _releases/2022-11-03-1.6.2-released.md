## Stats

In this release we included [5 changes since the 1.6.1 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.6.2) by 7 contributors. We thank all the effort put into improving the language! ❤️

Here we list most important fixes. For more details, visit the [changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.6.2).

## Compiler

The most important fix is a regression in the compiler which is now [fixed](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/12709). At the moment we don't have a minimized version of what caused it, check the PR for details.

## Windows and OpenSSL

The Windows package includes the OpenSSL 3 library. Since there was a recent [security issue](https://openssl.org/blog/blog/2022/11/01/email-address-overflows) fixed in the latest version of OpenSSL, we updated it accordingly.
