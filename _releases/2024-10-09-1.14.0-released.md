We are announcing a new Crystal release with several new features and bug fixes.

Pre-built packages are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.14.0)
and our official distribution channels.
See [crystal-lang.org/install](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) for
installation instructions.

## Stats

This release includes [❓ changes since 1.13.3](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.14.0)
by ❓ contributors. We thank all the contributors for all the effort put into
improving the language! ❤️

## Advances in multi-threading support

The [project to improve multi-threading support](/2024/02/09/84codes-manas-mt) with the help of [84codes] is still ongoing.
This release doesn't include any big changes. There are a couple of smaller concurrency improvements, though.

We expect to roll out a major performance upgrade to the event loop for the 1.15 development cycle.
See [New Event Loop (UNIX): call for reviews & tests](https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t/new-event-loop-unix-call-for-reviews-tests/7207)
for a heads up.

The upcoming execution contexts API from [RFC 2](https://github.com/crystal-lang/rfcs/pull/2) is available as a standalone shard for testing:
[`ysbaddaden/execution_context`](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/execution_context).

## Changes

Below we list the most remarkable changes in the language, compiler and stdlib.
For more details, visit the [full changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.14.0).

### Breaking

⚠️ `Slice#[start, count]` now accepts a negative index for `start`, like similar methods already do.
This would break existing code that depends on the current behaviour that a negative start index raises `IndexError` ([#14778]).

[#14778]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14778

⚠️ Finalizers for `Socket` and `IO::FileDescriptor` do no longer flush.
We realized that flushing is too heavy for a finalizer, as it might involve the event loop and even memory allocations which must be strictly avoided in a finalizer.
Be sure to always flush before letting a stream go out of scope, ideally with an explicit `#close` ([#14882]).

[#14882]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14882

⚠️ `XML::Error.errors` had been deprecated since [1.7.0](/_releases/2023-01-09-1.7.0-released.md), but continued to work.
This unconditioned availability causes a serious memory leak, which cannot be fixed without disabling `XML::Error.errors`.
In order to make this obvious, calling the method causes a compile time error now. ([#14936]).

[#14936]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14936

⚠️ `Hash::Entry` has been removed from public API docs. It was never intended to be a public type. ([#14881]).

*Thanks [@ysbaddaden], [@straight-shoota] and [@Blacksmoke16]*

[#14881]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14881

### Language features

Allow `^` in constant numeric expressions ([#14951]). This operator was oddly missing even though `|` and `&` were already supported.

*Thanks [@HertzDevil]*

[#14951]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14951

`HashLiteral` and `NamedTupleLiteral` respond to `#has_key?`, just like their regular counterparts `Hash` and `NamedTuple` ([#14890]).

*Thanks [@kamil-gwozdz]*

### Standard library

The `WaitGroup` concurrency primitive gains some convenience methods,
`WaitGroup.wait` and `WaitGroup#spawn` ([#14837]).

```crystal
require "wait_group"
WaitGroup.wait do |wg|
  10.times do
    wg.spawn do
      sleep 5.seconds
    end
  end
end
```

*Thanks [@jgaskins]*

[#14837]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14837

There are two new methods for working with slices: `Slice#same?`checks
if two slices point to the same memory ([#14728]).
And `Pointer::Appender#to_slice` ([#14874]) makes it easy to create a slice
containing the items from an appender.

[#14728]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14728
[#14874]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14874

*Thanks [@straight-shoota]*

A minor fix turning an eager class getter into a lazy one avoids linking `libpcre`
for programs that do not use `Regex` ([#14891]).

*Thanks [@kojix2]*

[#14891]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14891

### Windows

Windows support is making good progress.

The interpreter runs on Windows ([#14964]). There is still a limitation:
networking does not work due to [#12495].

And Crystal now runs on ARM64 Windows, i.e. the `aarch64-windows-msvc` target.
Both standard library and the compiler should work. It's not 100% polished, but
looking pretty well. Read [#14911] for details on how to test it out.

Starting with this release, DNS requests resolve asynchronously on Windows ([#14979]).
It's actually the first platform to support that.

There are also a number of improvements regarding non-blocking IO:

- Support non-blocking `File#read` and `#write` ([#14940]), `File#read_at` ([#14958]), `Process.run` standard streams ([#14941]), `IO::FileDescriptor#flock_*` ([#14943]).
- Emulate non-blocking `STDIN` console ([#14947]).
- Open non-blocking regular files as overlapped ([#14921]).

And we add implementations of `System::User` ([#14933]) and `System::Group` on Windows ([#14945]).

*Thanks [@HertzDevil]*

### `URI::Params`

`URI::Params::Serializable` is a new serialization API which works similar to
the JSON and YAML variants, but for the URI query parameters format ([#14684]).

```crystal
require "uri/params/serializable"

record Applicant,
  first_name : String
  last_name : String
  qualities : Array(String) do
  include URI::Params::Serializable
end

applicant = Applicant.from_www_form "first_name=John&last_name=Doe&qualities=kind&qualities=smart"
applicant # => Applicant(@first_name="John", @last_name="Doe", @qualities=["kind", "smart"])
applicant.to_www_form # => "first_name=John&last_name=Doe&qualities=kind&qualities=smart"
```

*Thanks [@Blacksmoke16]*

In a related matter, `URI` is now applicable as a key in JSON objects via `URI.from_json_object_key?` ([#14834]).

*Thanks [@nobodywasishere]*

[#14834]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14834
[#14684]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14684

### Compiler tools

The compiler binary can now execute external programs as subcommands:
`crystal foo` tries to run `crystal-foo` if `foo` is not an internal command.
This allows us to split the compiler binary into separate executables which helps
improve iteration speed ([#14953]).

*Thanks [@bcardiff]*

[#14953]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14953

### Performance

This release includes some minor performance improvements, particularly in the
compiler ([#14748], [#14992], [#15002]).

*Thanks [@ysbaddaden], [@HertzDevil], [@ggiraldez]*

[#15002]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/15002
[#14992]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14992
[#14748]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14748

### Dependency Updates

- `LibCrypto` bindings now support LibreSSL 3.5+ ([#14872]).
- Support for Unicode 16.0.0 ([#14997]).
- Support for LLVM 19.1 ([#14842])

*Thanks [@straight-shoota], [@HertzDevil]*

[#14842]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14842
[#14872]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14872
[#14997]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14997

## Deprecations

`Pointer.new(Int)` was deprecated in favour of `Pointer.new(UInt64)` ([#14875]).
Deprecation warnings for argument type that autocast to `UInt64` can be ignored
or disabled by explicitly casting to `UInt64`.

*Thanks [@straight-shoota]*

[#14875]: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14875

We updated a couple of APIs that receive a time span argument.
`Benchmark.ips` ([#14805]) and `::sleep` ([#14962]) now explicitly require
`Time::Span`. The overloads with `Number` are deprecated.
You can convert bare numbers with `Int#seconds` to use the valid overload.

*Thanks [@HertzDevil]*
