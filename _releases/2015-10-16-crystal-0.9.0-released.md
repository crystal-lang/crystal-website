[Crystal 0.9.0](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.9.0) has been released!

This release introduces a built-in formatter that you can invoke with `crystal tool format`.
It also comes integrated in our [Sublime Text plugin](https://github.com/crystal-lang/sublime-crystal),
and we encourage plugin writers to integrate it into other editors too.

Some things the formatter does:

<ul class="goals" style="padding-bottom:20px">
  <li>Applies a consistent indenting of two spaces</li>
  <li>Leaves no spaces before and after parentheses, leaves spaces after commas and between operators</li>
  <li>Leaves no more than two consecutive newlines</li>
  <li>Aligns expressions in the right side of an assignment</li>
  <li>Aligns consecutive comments, constants, <code>when</code> expressions and hash literals</li>
  <li>Formats code inside doc comments, so also doc comments look nice and consistent</li>
</ul>

We encourage you to try it out! :-)

Another good thing is that [shards](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/shards) is included
in the official packages.
