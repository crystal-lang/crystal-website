## Interpreter

## Windows Support

With over [30 individual changes](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.3.0+label%3Aplatform%3Awindows) there has been great progress for improving Windows support.

It's still not yet a fully supported platform and there's no official distribution package for this release.
But we've started building self-contained and portable distribution packages for nightlies. You can grab the current build at [nightly.link/crystal-lang/crystal/workflows/win/master/crystal.zip](https://nightly.link/crystal-lang/crystal/workflows/win/master/crystal.zip). There is also a repository for the scoop package manager at [neatorobito/scoop-crystal](https://github.com/neatorobito/scoop-crystal).
Together with many smaller improvements in the compiler, user experience on Windows has greatly improved.

One of the most important missing features has been added: Stacktraces. Now you can properly follow where your exceptions come from on Windows ([#11461](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11461)).

Additionally, several stdlib APIs have been ported to windows, including `Big` numbers ([#11412](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11412)), `OpenSSL` ([#11477](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11477)), and text encoding ([#11480](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11480)).
As a result, 96% of stdlib specs run successfully on Windows now.

## Unicode

## Syscalls

## Multi-Assign

## Number Autocast

## Improved Numerical Support / Lexing Number Literals
