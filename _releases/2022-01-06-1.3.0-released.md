## 128-bit Literals

The parser has been improved to understand number literals in the full range or 128-bit integers ([#11571](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11571)).
Until now, 128-bit literals had been supported only within the limits of 64-bit values.

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
1_i128                                       # Works in 1.2.2 and 1.3.0
170141183460469231731687303715884105727_i128 # Fails in 1.2.2, works in 1.3.0
{% endhighlight %}</div>

In order to get there, we needed to implement some arithmetic primitives for all platforms, and refactor the parsing of number literals ([#11211](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11211)).
The latter also cleaned up a couple of edge cases. Some examples are highlighted here:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
1_.1   # Error: unexpected '_' in number
-0u64  # Error: Invalid negative value -0 for UInt64
-0_u64 # Error: Invalid negative value -0 for UInt64
1__2   # Error: consecutive underscores in numbers aren't allowed
0x_2   # Error: unexpected '_' in number
0_12   # Error: octal constants should be prefixed with 0o
0e40   # => 0.0
0x     # Error: numeric literal without digits
{% endhighlight %}</div>
