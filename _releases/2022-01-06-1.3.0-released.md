## Stats

In this release we included [XXX PRs since the 1.2.2 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.3.0) by XXX contributors. We thank all the effort put into improving the language and its stdlib! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Interpreter

## Windows Support

## Unicode

There are a couple of changes related to Unicode support.

Most significant is that [`Char#inspect`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0/Char.html#inspect%3AString-instance-method) and [`#dump`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0/Char.html#dump%3AString-instance-method) as well as [`String#inspect`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0/String.html#inspect%3AString-instance-method) and [`#dump`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0/String.html#dump%3AString-instance-method) escape all non-printable characters ([#11452](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11452)).

Further, we added an API for Unicode extended grapheme clusters at [`String::Grapheme`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0/String/Grapheme.html) (
[#11472](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11472)). It allows splitting a string into grapheme clusters which represent a user-percieved character and may consist of multiple code points.

<div class="code_section">{% highlight crystal %}
"aüëçüèºaÃÄ".graphemes # => [String::Grapheme('a'), String::Grapheme("üëçüèº"), String::Grapheme("aÃÄ")]
"aüëçüèºaÃÄ".chars     # => ['a', 'üëç', 'üèº', 'a', 'ÃÄ']

"aüëçüèºaÃÄ".grapheme_size # => 3
"aüëçüèºaÃÄ".size          # => 5
{% endhighlight %}</div>

This API is experimental for now, and we expect to further refine it in the following releases.

Further enhancements:

* New: [`Char#unicode_escape`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0Char.html#unicode_escape%3AString-instance-method) returns the unicode escape sequence representing the character ([#11421](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11421)).
* New: [`Char#printable?`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0Char.html#printable%3F-instance-method) returns `true` for printable characters, i.e. those with a visible glyph as well as the ASCII whitespace (`U+0020`) ([#11429](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11429)).
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix: [`Char#ascii_control?`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0Char.html#ascii_control%3F%3ABool-instance-method) no longer applies to *C1 control codes*. They are not part of the ASCII character set ([#11510](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11510)).
* Fix: [`Char#letter?`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0Char.html#letter%3F%3ABool-instance-method) correctly identifies code points in the Unicode general categories `Lo` (*Other Letter*) and `Lm` (*Modifier Letter*) as letters ([#11474](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11474)).
* Standardized unicode escape formats for [`Char#inspect`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0Char.html#inspect%3AString-instance-method) and [`#dump`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.3.0Char.html#dump%3AString-instance-method) ([#11421](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11421)).
