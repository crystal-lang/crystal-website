## Stats

In this patch release we included [13 PRs since the 1.5.0 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.5.1) by 7 contributors. We thank all the effort put into improving the language! ❤️

## Remarkable changes

A regression introduced in 1.5.0 prevented the typechecker to correctly infer the type of a union of a splat of types (something of the form `Union(*T)`). This is now fixed.

To illustrate, the following code typechecks in 1.4.1 but not in 1.5.0.

```crystal
class Foo(*T)
  @value : Union(*T)

  def initialize(@value)
  end
end

p Foo(Int32, String).new(3), Foo(Int32, String).new("")
```
