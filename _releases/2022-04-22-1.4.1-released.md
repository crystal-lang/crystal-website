We are releasing the first patch release of the [1.4](https://crystal-lang.org/2022/04/06/1.4.0-released.html) series.

Pre-built packages are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.4.1) and our official distribution channels.
See [crystal-lang.org/install](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) for installation instructions.

## Stats

In this patch release we included [5 PRs since the 1.4.0 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.4.1) by 4 contributors. We thank all the effort put into improving the language! ❤️

## Remarkable changes

Prior to 1.4.0, the following code will raise at runtime an illegal access error:

```crystal
module M
  @a = 'a'
end

class A
  @a = 'b'
end

class B < A
  include M

  @c = true
end
```

As a quick workaround, in 1.4.0 we disabled the possibility to define an instance variable in a class and an included module. The same code will then throw an error at compile time: `Error: instance variable '@a' of B is already defined in A`.

However, as it turned out, in some cases it was possible to define the same instance variable in a class and in an including module: if `B` above weren't defining its own instance variable (`@c`), then that code runs fine in Crystal 1.3.2. In [#11995](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11995) this was fixed for good, and now instance variables having compatible types are allowed to be defined in a class and an including module.
