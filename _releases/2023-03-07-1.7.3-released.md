We are releasing the third patch release of the [1.7](/2023/01/09/1.7.0-released/) series.

Pre-built packages are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.7.3) and our official distribution channels.
See [crystal-lang.org/install](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) for installation instructions.

This patch includes a bugfix for a regression introduced in 1.7.0 and several bugfixes and a performance regression fix for supporting the PCRE2 regex library.

The regression affected the compiler. Prior to 1.7.0 it wasn't checking that numeric arguments of generics were matching. The fix in 1.7.0 however [affected the inference](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/13110) of numeric arguments.

The fixes for PCRE2 are important to help migrating projects into the newly supported library when testing it with `-Duse_pcre2`. Mind that support for the old regex library will gradually [fade out](https://crystal-lang.org/2023/03/02/crystal-is-upgrading-its-regex-engine/).

If you find any further issue, please [report it](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/).
