## Changes

Below we list the most remarkable changes in the language, compiler and stdlib.
For more details, visit the [full changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.16.3).

This change brings a couple of bugfixes for regressions introduced in 1.16.0 and 1.16.1.

The most important fix is a regression from 1.16.0 where we merged type IDs by name which revealed a semantic
bug in typing pointer values ([#15751]).
We're also fixing a regression form 1.16.2 which made the compiler incompatible with earlier versions of the standard library ([#15762]).
