We are releasing the second patch release of the [1.2](https://crystal-lang.org/2021/10/14/1.2.0-released.html) series.

In this patch release we included [15 PRs since the 1.2.1 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.2.2) by 5 contributors.

## Fixes

We have fixed three regressions in the compiler, two of them related to debug mode:

* Virtual metaclasses missed a type restriction ([#11397](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/11376)) since 1.2.0.
* Debug locations were missing for some const and class var read calls ([#11417](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11417)). This only affected `--debug` builds since 1.2.0.
* Debug locations were missing for some union types ([#11390](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11390)). This only affected `--debug` builds since 1.2.1.

Among the other bug fixes, [#11344](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11344)
fixed a long-standing codegen bug for passing structs in the x86_64 ABI.

## Support for OpenSSL 3 and LibreSSL

We added support for binding against OpenSSL 3.0 ([#11360](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11360)) and restored support for LibreSSL ([#11400](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11400)), which can both be used as alternatives to OpenSSL 1.x.

## Support for DWARF 5

We also added support for DWARF 5 when reading debug info for stack traces ([#11399](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11399)).
GCC 11 uses this version by default, so we're set for that.

Unrelated to DWARF 5 support, stack traces now show the filenames of shared libraries ([#11408](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11408)).
