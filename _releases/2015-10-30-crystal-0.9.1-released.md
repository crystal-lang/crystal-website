[Crystal 0.9.1](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.9.1) has been released!

This is a small release with many improvements to the formatter, so it's more consistent and less obtrusive.
Starting from this release, the standard library and compiler's code will be formatted using it, and we expect
pull requests and contributions to also use the formatter.

This release also comes with [shards 0.5.3](https://github.com/ysbaddaden/shards/releases/tag/v0.5.3) and contains some minor bug fixes and additions to the standard library.
