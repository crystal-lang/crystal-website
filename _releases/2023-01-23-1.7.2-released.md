We are releasing the second patch release of the [1.7](/2023/01/09/1.7.0-released/) series.

Pre-built packages are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.7.2) and our official distribution channels.
See [crystal-lang.org/install](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) for installation instructions.

This patch includes two bugfixes for regressions introduced in 1.7.0 and a minor UX bug in the compiler.
The parser in 1.7.0 added more restrictions on what tokens can follow immediately after the name in a class definition. This was too restrictive and unintentionally affected code that should be considered valid ([#12977](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/12977)).
Changes in 1.7.0 to an internal runtime method for loading debug info lead to a side-effect on large IO operations on some platforms. The exact reasons for this codegen bug are not entirely understood yet, but a workaround fixes the immediate effect.
Finally, there's a fix for an annyoing compiler error predominantly appearing for Windows users which don't have a linker installed ([#12899](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/12899)).

If you find any further issue, please [report it](https://crystal-lang.org/issues).
