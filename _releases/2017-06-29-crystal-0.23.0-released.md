[Crystal 0.23.0](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.23.0) has been released!

As any release it includes numerous bugfixes, cool features and performance improvements.

# Exciting Changes

* The release is built with LLVM 3.8, so it's no longer supported by Debian 7 and CentOS.
* **(breaking-change)** Severity levels are now passed as `Severity` type to `Logger#formatter`, instead of a `String`.
* **(breaking-change)** `IO.select` was removed.
* The compiler now indicates compilation progress with command line flag `--progress`.
* File listing can be disabled for `HTTP::StaticFileHandler`.
* `crystal init` generates a `.editorconfig` file.
* We have a man page for `crystal(1)`.
* When re-rasing an exception, it's callstack won't be overwritten.

Thanks to everyone who supported this release through contributions, reviews and suggestions.
