## Changes

Below we list the most remarkable changes in the language, compiler and stdlib.
For more details, visit the [full changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.16.2).

This change brings a couple of bugfixes for regressions introduced in 1.16.0.

The most important fix is for a performance regression in the compiler which
for some programs would blow up compile time ([#15708]). This was particularly
observed with `-Dexecution_context`, but it's not dependent on that.

Other bug fixes are specific to execution contexts:

- `Fiber::ExecutionContext::Isolated#wait` now suspends the fiber ([#15720]).
- `CRYSTAL_LOAD_DEBUG_INFO=1` now works with `-Dexecution_context` ([#15704], [#15724]).

Other changes:

- `Int#humanize_bytes` shows the `unit_separator` even if the prefix is empty ([#15683]).
- Remove double listing `ReferenceStorage` as a sub type of `Value` ([#15706]).
