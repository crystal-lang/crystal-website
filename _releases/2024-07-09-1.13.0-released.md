We are announcing a new Crystal release with several new features and bug fixes.

Pre-built packages are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.13.0)
and our official distribution channels.
See [crystal-lang.org/install](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) for
installation instructions.

## Stats

This release includes [XX changes since 1.12.2](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.13.0)
by ZZZ contributors. We thank all the contributors for all the effort put into
improving the language! ❤️

## Changes

Below we list the most remarkable changes in the language, compiler and stdlib.
For more details, visit the [full changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.13.0).

### Breaking

- The `CRYSTAL_LIBRARY_RPATH` compiler config and the delay-load helper are removed ([#14598](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14598)). They were an only (partially) functional attempt for dynamic linking on Windows. By now they have been replaced with a more robust solution to actually [install DLLs via `@[Link]` annotation](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/13858).
  _Thanks [@HertzDevil]_

- Never raise `IndexError` in `#[]?(Range)` ([#14444](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14444)).
  _Thanks [@HertzDevil]_

- Fixed `Set#to_a(&)` ([#14519](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14519)).
  _Thanks [@meatball133]_

- Restore leading zero in exponent for `printf("%e")` and `printf("%g")` ([#14695](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/14682)). This fixes a regression introduced in Crystal 1.11.0.
  _Thanks [@straight-shoota]_

- Disable implicit execution of batch files on Windows ([#14557](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14557)).
  _Thanks [@straight-shoota]_

- The module `IO::Evented` was removed from the public API docs  ([#14749]). It is an internal implementation detail and was erroneously exposed in the docs.
  _Thanks [@straight-shoota]_

#### OpenSSL Default Configuration

The `OpenSSL` bindings previously included some explicit overrides for the default settings of the SSL library. This can be useful to improve the security level when working with older library versions. But it has the opposite effect with newer library versions and hinders the application of more restrictive default configurations.
We removed overrides for cipher suites ([#14655](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14655)) and ECDH curve ([#14656](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14656)). The TLS Server compatibility level recommendations from Mozilla are deprecated as well. They didn't even work correctly before ([#14657](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14657)).
`OpenSSL` now uses the default configuration of the SSL library. Explicit overrides in user code are still possible of course.

_Thanks [@ysbaddaden]_

### Rescue module types

Exception matching in `rescue` now supports module types in the type restriction.

```crystal
module ErrorModule; end

class SomeError < Exception
  include ErrorModule
end

begin
  raise SomeError.new
rescue ex : ErrorModule
end
```

 This gives more flexibility for exception hierarchies allowing multiple ancestors instead of only a single super class. For example, you can have a common module for all exceptions of a specific part of a library, while they can still inherit from different external exception types.
 More details in [#14552](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14552)

_Thanks [@Blacksmoke16]_

### Macros

- _(macros)_ Add AST node methods for macro-related nodes ([#14492](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14492), thanks @HertzDevil)
- _(macros)_ Add macro methods for `Select` ([#14600](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14600), thanks @HertzDevil)
- _(macros)_ Add `TypeNode#private?`, `#public?` and `#visibility` ([#11696](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11696), thanks @Hadeweka)
- Add `StringLiteral#to_utf16` ([#14676](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14676), thanks @ysbaddaden)

### Runtime Tracing

The Crystal runtime has a new tracing feature for low level functionality. It currently covers garbage collector and scheduler activity ([#14659](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14659)).
A program built with `-Dtracing` prints diagnostic info when enabled via environment variable `CRYSTAL_TRACE=all` (or `CRYSTAL_TRACE=gc`, `CRYSTAL_TRACE=sched`). Output goes to `STDERR` by default, but can be configured via `CRYSTAL_TRACE_FILE=tracing.log`.

```console
$ crystal build -Dtracing hello-world.cr
$ CRYSTAL_TRACE=sched ./hello-world
sched.spawn 70569399740240 thread=0x7f48d7dc9740:? fiber=0x7f48d7cd0f00:main fiber=0x7f48d7cd0dc0:Signal Loop
sched.enqueue 70569399831716 thread=0x7f48d7dc9740:? fiber=0x7f48d7cd0f00:main fiber=0x7f48d7cd0dc0:Signal Loop duration=163
Hello World
```

_Thanks [@ysbaddaden]_

### `WaitGroup`

A [`WaitGroup`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.13.0/WaitGroup.html) is a declarative counter of concurrent fibers. Each such fiber is expected to call `#done` when it has finished. Whenever the counter reaches zero the waiters are resumed.
This is a simpler and more efficient alternative to `Channel(Nil)`.
Read more in [#14167](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14167).

```crystal
require "wait_group"

wg = WaitGroup.new

5.times do
  wg.add
  spawn do
    puts "waiting..."
    sleep rand.seconds
  ensure
    wg.done
  end
end

# suspend the current fiber until the 5 fibers are done
wg.wait
```

_Thanks [@ysbaddaden]_
### Compiler

* New compiler flags `-Os` and `-Oz` to optimize binary size ([#14463](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14463)).
  _Thanks [@ysbaddaden]_

* Basic compiler support for AVR architecture (Arduino) ([#14393](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14393)).
  _Thanks [@ysbaddaden]_

* Do not strip the macOS target triple ([#14466](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14466)).
  _Thanks [@hovsater]_

### Misc

* Add UUID v7 implementation ([#14732](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14732))
  _Thanks [@jgaskins]_

* New method: `Array#insert_all` ([#14486](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14486))
  _Thanks [@summer-alice]_

## Deprecations

* `File.readable?`, `.writable?`, `.executable?` are moved to `File::Info`. They are low-level methods and removing them from the prominent `File` namespace reduces potential for confusion. ([#14484](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14484))
  _Thanks [@straight-shoota]_
