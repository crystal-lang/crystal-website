We are releasing the first patch release of the [1.2](https://crystal-lang.org/2021/10/14/1.2.0-released.html) series.

## Stats

In this patch release we included [4 PRs since the 1.2.1 release](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.2.1) by 4 contributors. This time we'd like to thank the developers that suffered and issued the regressions ❤️ Sorry about that!

There are just three relevant changes to point out:

## Fixes

We had two major regression fixes. The first on is related to the introduction of [`markd`](https://github.com/icyleaf/markd/) to render the API docs ([#11040](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11040)). This lead to a [bug](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/11323) that was fixed in a recent `markd` version ([#11338](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11338)).

The second one is that class variables with a regex [stopped working](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/11318) in 1.2.0. We fixed it in [#11334](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/11334).

## LLVM 13 support

Not really a regression, but since LLVM 13 is already out and fixes several bugs that affected Crystal, we decided to start making it available in this patch release. As soon as your platform makes it available to you, you might want to check it out!
