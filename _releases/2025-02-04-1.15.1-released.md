## Changes

This patch release fixes two regressions from 1.15.0. They are only affecting
some specific use cases, though.

We also fixed an issue in `HTTP::StaticFileHandler` where `directory_listing=false` could lead to infinite redirection loops ([#15393]).

Other changes are fixing documentation and improving internal infrastructure,
such as making the release process more reliable.
