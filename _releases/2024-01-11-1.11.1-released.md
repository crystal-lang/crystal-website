## Changes

The changes are fixes for minor regression bugs in the standard library and compiler.

For more details, visit the [full changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.11.1).

If you find any further issues, please [report them](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/).

- The interpreter couldn't find `pthread.so` on systems with a modern glibc when the pkg-config file for `libgc` was available. This is now fixed ([#14198]).
- The newly introduced `ReferenceStorage` type was dropped again because its integration caused compatibility issues with older versions of the standard library ([#14207]). It will come back with an improved implementation.
- The change for supporting OpenSSL was also reverted because it seemed to be not working correctly ([#14217]). A new implementation is on its way and we hope to release an update soon.
