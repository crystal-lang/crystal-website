[Crystal 0.15.0](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/0.15.0) has been released!

This is a small release where the most significant change is that now `!` and `nil?`
have their meaning hardcoded in the language. To understand why this is important let's look at a simple example.

## nil? and !

The task is to write a program that prints the character number of an occurrence of a string
inside another string, or print "Not found" if not found.

One way to solve this is:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight ruby %}
# `String#index` returns an Int32 if the index is found, or Nil if not
index = "some_word".index(ARGV[0])
if index
  puts "Found at character number #{index + 1}"
else
  puts "Not found"
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}</div>

Note that in the above program the first character, for the user, is 1, the second is 2, etc.
That's why we need to add 1 to the index.

The compiler understands that if `index` is truthy (not `nil` nor `false` nor a null pointer)
then inside the `then` branch `index` can only be `Int32` so the operation `index + 1`
compiles fine.

Another way to write the same program is this:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight ruby %}
index = "some_word".index(ARGV[0])
if !index
  puts "Not found"
else
  puts "Found at character number #{index + 1}"
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}</div>

If you compile the above program in a previous version you will get an error:

<pre class="code">
Error in ./file.cr:14: undefined method '+' for Nil (compile-time type is Int32?)

  puts "Found at character number #{index + 1}"
                                          ^
</pre>

In this case it would seem obvious that in the `else` branch there's no possible
way `index` can be `nil`. However, because `!` was a regular method and anyone could
redefine its meaning, the compiler couldn't make this guarantee.

Now `!` has its meaning hardcoded, which means that the last program compiles just fine.

Yet another way to write the same program is this:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight ruby %}
index = "some_word".index(ARGV[0])
if index.nil?
  puts "Not found"
else
  puts "Found at character number #{index + 1}"
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}</div>

As before, if you compile this with a previous version you will get the same error,
for the same reason: you could redefine the meaning of `nil?`.

Starting from 0.15.0 `nil?` has its meaning hardcoded, so the above program again works
just fine.

This is super important because now the language is much more intuitive and correct.
And there are many Ruby programmers that use `nil?`, a lot, and if they start using
Crystal there won't be any surprises in their expectations about what the compiler should
understand in these cases.

Some others ways to write this program:

<div class="code_section">{% highlight ruby %}
# 1
if !index.nil?
  puts "Found at character number #{index + 1}"
else
  puts "Not found"
end

# 2
if index.is_a?(Int32)
  puts "Found at character number #{index + 1}"
else
  puts "Not found"
end

# 3
if !index.is_a?(Int32)
  puts "Not found"
else
  puts "Found at character number #{index + 1}"
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}</div>

All of the above will now work just fine, as one would expect.

We originally considered removing `nil?` from the standard library and language, but `Nil`
is such a fundamental type that it makes sense to have good support for handling it.

And remember: `nil` is not a [billion dollar mistake](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare)
if the compiler takes care of making sure you always handle it.

## Better Playground

The [playground](http://crystal-lang.org/2016/03/21/crystal-0.14.1-released.html#the-playground) (`crystal play`)
had many bug fixes, stablizations and improvements. For example runtime exceptions are now pointed
out in the source code.

There's also a new "Workbook" tab/section that can list files you put in a `playground` directory,
to use it as a tutorial for others, or maybe when giving a talk. These files can be HTML,
Markdown or Crystal files.

For example, [@will](https://github.com/will) gave a talk about Crystal a few days ago
at [Ruby on Ales](https://ruby.onales.com/speakers#introducingthecrystalprogramminglanguage-by-willleinweber)
and used it to introduce the language. Make sure to [check out his repo](https://github.com/will/roa2016_crystal)
and try it out.
