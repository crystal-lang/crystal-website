## Changes

This release fixes two compiler bugs which became apparent with the upgrade to LLVM 18.
Since LLVM 18 the alignment of some types has changed (e.g. `Int128` goes from 8 to 16 byte alignment).
The compiler didn't expect an alignment bigger than 8 bytes in some cases.
These misalignments are now fixed ([#14906], [#14843]).

_Thanks [@HertzDevil]_

Other bug fixes are atomic allocation for `ReferenceStorage(T)` if `T` has no inner pointers ([#14845])
and explicitly clearing deleted `Hash::Entry` ([#14862]).
